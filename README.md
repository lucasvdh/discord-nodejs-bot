# Discord NodeJS Bot

A NodeJS Discord bot that can do some stuff to make your life easier.

### Link loading

Have you ever had that you had to click an instagram or facebook links to actually see the video or photo that was posted? 
Those days are no more! 

If someone posts a link and this bot can find the corresponding image or video for it, it will send it as a file to the channel the link was posted in. 

Current supported media types are:
- Instagram images
- Instagram videos
- Facebook videos
